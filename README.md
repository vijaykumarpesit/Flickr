1.FLPhotoDisplayViewModel   Functionality of this view model is divided in to individual responsibility owners like datasource 
2.Followed protocol oriented programming for Data and business layer like data source, FLPhotoDisplayViewModel
Nice to have:
1.More test coverage and UI test cases  
2.Use mapping and validator for json parsing instead of heavily depending on codable protocol.
